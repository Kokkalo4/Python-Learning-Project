Python Learning Project:

Recently I followed an online Python Learning course called "30 Days of Python" that helped me get the basics of Python and apply them to real life situations. In this repository i will upload all the scripts that were created during the course.

The scripts that are uploaded include the following:
1) [Strings and Numbers](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/1%20Strings%20Numbers.py)
2) [Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/2%20Lists%20Dictionaries%20Tuples.py)
3) [Loops](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/3%20Loops.py)
4) [Conditionals](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/4%20Conditionals.py)
5) [Functions](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/5%20Functions.py)
6) [Advanced Strings](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/6%20Advanced%20Strings.py)
7) [Classes](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/7%20Classes.py)
8) [More on Classes](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/8%20More%20on%20Classes.py)
9) [Converting Functions to Classes](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/9%20Converting%20Function%20to%20Class.py)
10) [Importing data to Python](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/10%20Importing%20to%20Python.py)
11) [Creating and Sending e-mails with Python and Gmail](https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Python-Learning-Project/blob/master/11%20Setup%20Python%20to%20Send%20Email%20with%20Gmail.py)
