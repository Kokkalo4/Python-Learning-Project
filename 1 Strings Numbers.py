#Numbers can be used as numbers and perform all arithmetic functions but they can also be used inside strings.
#With numbers you can perform all math operations.
2 * 2

#or you can multiply strings.
"abc" * 2

#The output of multiplying a string with a number is printing the value of the string twice.
